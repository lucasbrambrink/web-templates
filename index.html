                                        in the astronomy department at UC Berkeley.

                                        I study the circumgalactic medium and galactic winds. 
                                        Essentially, we look at how galaxies get their gas 
                                        and how they expel it.

                                        In the modern paradigm for the formation of structure in our universe, 
                                        matter over-densities imprinted during the big bang collapse to form 
                                        ‘halos’ of dark matter. These dark matter halos are initially filled 
                                        with hot gas heated to the virial temperature by an accretion shock. 
                                        Though the gravitational process of structure formation is self-similar, 
                                        pioneering work in the 1970’s recognized that the cooling of halo 
                                        gas ultimately differentiates galaxies from more massive systems such as 
                                        galaxy groups or clusters. In galaxies with sufficiently low mass, halo 
                                        gas can in principle 
                                        cool, accrete, and play a role in star formation. In galaxy clusters, on 
                                        the other hand, halo gas cannot cool and instead persists for the age of 
                                        the universe, essentially independent of the galaxy formation taking 
                                        place at smaller radii. The transition between these two outcomes for halo 
                                        gas occurs around a total mass of ∼10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, 
                                        relatively independent of redshift. Thus, a seemingly small distinction 
                                        related to atomic physics ultimately drives all of the marked observational 
                                        differences between galaxies and galaxy clusters. The basic physics of halo 
                                        gas therefore plays a primary, but relatively unexplored, role in our 
                                        history of the universe and the types of structures that form within it.

                                        Until recently, we had only indirect measurements of halo gas in galaxies. 
                                        As a result, current cosmological simulations have been tuned to reproduce 
                                        the stellar properties of galaxies, which are much better constrained from
                                        observations. As new observational techniques begin to probe the halo gas 
                                        in galaxies, however, it will become increasingly important to improve the 
                                        prescriptions for gas physics in our models. Many of the new 
                                        observations—particularly the HST COS quasar absorption spectra observations 
                                        (e.g., Werk et al. 2014)—are at odds with the predictions from state-of-the-art 
                                        cosmological simulations. Predicting, observing, and understanding the properties 
                                        of halo gas represents the new frontier in galaxy formation.

                                        In our first paper on this topic, we use idealized three-dimensional hydrodynamic 
                                        simulations to study the dynamics and thermal structure of the circumgalactic 
                                        medium (CGM) resulting from the interplay of cooling and stellar feedback in the 
                                        presence of cosmological accretion of gas. As in the pioneering calculations 
                                        without stellar feedback (e.g., Birnboim & Dekel 2003; Keres et al 2005), we find 
                                        that above a critical halo mass (∼10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) halo gas is 
                                        supported by thermal pressure created in the halo virial shock. The thermal 
                                        properties of the halo gas at small radii (near any central galaxy) are regulated 
                                        by feedback triggered when t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub> ~ 1−10 in the hot halo 
                                        gas. Below a critical halo mass, ∼10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, however, there is 
                                        no thermally supported halo. Instead, the halo gas properties are determined by the 
                                        interaction between inflowing gas and galactic winds. The halo gas is not in 
                                        thermal pressure balance, but is instead effectively supported by random motions 
                                        and outflow ram pressure. This may explain the failure of pressure equilibrium to 
                                        account for the properties of cool halo gas inferred from COS observations.

                                        We use local Cartesian simulations with a vertical gravitational potential to study how supernova (SN) feedback in stratified galactic discs drives turbulence and launches galactic winds. Our analysis includes three disc models with gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes (random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics of SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We find that, in these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low mass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ~3-7 km/s and low wind mass loading factors, less than 1, in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and wind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are significantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly star-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc galaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests and analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the properties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global geometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors are in fact not well-defined in local simulations because they decline significantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic calculations (e.g., including a global galactic potential and disc rotation) will likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic outflows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.

                                        I did a small project with <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/faculty-profile/chris-mckee" target="_blank">Chris McKee</a> when I first arrived at Berkeley. We studied how the turbulent environment from which stars form may lead to misalignment between the stellar spin and the remnant protoplanetary disc. By using hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrated that a wide range of stellar obliquities may be produced as a by-product of forming a star within a turbulent environment. We presented a simple semi-analytic model that revealed this connection between the turbulent motions and the orientation of a star and its disk. Our results were consistent with the observed obliquity distribution of hot Jupiter, which indicates that the migration of misaligned hot Jupiters may be due to tidal dissipation in the disk, rather than tidal dissipation of the star-planet interaction.

                                        As an undergraduate I did a fun summer project with 
                                        <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/intro.html" target="_blank">Ned Wright</a> at UCLA. 
                                        Using Ned's rotating, cratered, thermophysical astroid model I modeled the light 
                                        curves of <a href="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">WISE</a> observed asteroids to 
                                        determine the asteroids' thermal properties. With an asteroid's specs (diameter,
                                        albedo, rotation rate, and so on) in hand I then modeled how they will evolve 
                                        due to the Yarkovsky (or YORP) effect. We focused on finding out which 
                                        asteroids will make it into mean-motion resonances with Jupiter—catapulting them 
                                        chaotically into other parts of the solar system, maybe even onto a collison course 
                                        with the earth! We also made some cool estimates about the parent asteroid family
                                        that may have spawed the dinosaur killing asteroid. 
                                    </p>

                                        The Yarkovsky effect is an elegant phenomenon in which the non-heliocentric 
                                        component of the radiation pressure of an asteroid can torque the asteroid causing 
                                        it to slowly drift. If an asteroid isn't rotating then the hottest part of the 
                                        asteroid, the part emitting most of the radiation, is point back to the sun, so 
                                        there is no torque. But, if an asteroid is rotating then due to thermal inertia the 
                                        hottest part is offset from the sub-solar point (this is the same reason why the hottest time of day isn't noon but 1 or 2 pm), which means the asteroid is 
                                        radiating away from the sun, and so there is a torque. The direction of the torque depends on the direction the asteroid is rotating.
